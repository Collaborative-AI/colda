Training:
1. A call S for permission (call for help) 
2. S search the people that can help A (search online users (later)
3. S send permission to the helpers (help permission) (2 or 3, later)
4. S requires A's ID, A send ID
5. S stores the ID and requires B for ID, B sends the ID
6. Match the ID
7. S informs the matched ID to A, B
8. A sends the initial situation to S (Json)
9. S transfers the initial situation to B
10. A,B train the local model based on the initial situation and the matched ID
11. B sends the output of the model to S, S sends the output of the model to A
12. A updates the initial situation and transmitts to S   (8-12, repeat T times, produce T local models)

Testing:
1. 1-7 same 
2. A, B tests the local models based on the matched ID => 2T results
3. B uploads T results to S. S transmits the T(B) results to A
4. A obtains the final results from B's results

xa ya xb => identified ID matching (xa+xb => ya)
