:py:mod:`~synspot.database` Module
==============================

The :py:mod:`~synspot.database` module contains a class of the same name to
represent the color palette of palette mapped images.

.. note::

    The :py:class:`~synspot.synspot.database.database` class has several methods,
    but they are all marked as "experimental." Read that as you will. The
    ``[source]`` link is there for a reason.
