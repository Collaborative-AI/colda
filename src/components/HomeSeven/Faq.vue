                                        Synspot provides Distributed Machine Learning as a Service (DMLasS) via Collaborative Data Analysis (ColDA) to form a machine learning community of shared interest. Synspot enables collaborators to conjointly learn machine learning models without sharing their data, models, and objectives with each other.

                                        Collaborative Data Analysis (ColDA) is a distributed generalization of the well-known Gradient Boosting algorithm which allows participants to collaboratively optimize the aggregate of local loss functions. Each participant autonomously builds its own model by iteratively fitting the pseudo-residuals.

                                        ColDA leverages local resources from participants to utilize the predictive power of external data and reduce computation overhead.
                                        ColDA generalizes the classical Gradient Boosting algorithm and allows participants to improve machine learning models without necessarily trusting each other.
                                        ColDA outperforms learning baselines and achieves near-oracle performance on various benchmark datasets. It applies to several real-world use cases such as recommender systems and time-series forecasting.
