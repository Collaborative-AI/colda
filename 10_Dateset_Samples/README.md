## Dataset samples

The recent generation of over 500 CSV files of stock information from `yfinance`, a well-known financial data provider, has resulted in a large and comprehensive dataset. The data, weighing in at over 500MB, contains the most current information on daily stock prices and other relevant metrics. The code used to generate this dataset can be found in the second folder of the attached GitHub repository. This dataset offers a wealth of information on various companies and markets, making it a valuable resource for analysis, research, financial modeling, and more. Its accuracy and detail make it an indispensable tool for anyone interested in the stock market and the performance of individual companies.

## Description of Data
Comprehensive stock datasets have been carefully crafted, providing valuable insights into the stock market and the performance of individual companies. The dataset contains key columns, including the "Date" column which records the date on which the stock price data was recorded. The "Open" and "Close" columns provide the opening and closing prices for the stock on that date, while the "High" and "Low" columns capture the highest and lowest prices reached on that date. Additionally, the "Volume" column records the total number of shares traded on that date, and the "Dividends" and "Stock Splits" columns provide information on any dividends paid and stock splits that occurred on that date. Together, these columns offer a comprehensive view of the stock market and the performance of individual companies.
- Note: The stock data is collected on a daily basis

## How to use
By executing the IPython notebook code located in the `20_Code` folder, users can generate a new set of CSV files that will overwrite the previous files with the same names. The new files will contain the most current information, including any updates or modifications made to the code. To run the code successfully, a compatible environment with all necessary dependencies and libraries must be in place. Upon successful execution, the new CSV files will be generated and saved in the same location as the original files. This process ensures that the dataset remains up-to-date and accurate, providing valuable insights into the stock market and the performance of individual companies.
