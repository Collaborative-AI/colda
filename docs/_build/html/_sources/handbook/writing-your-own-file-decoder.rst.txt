Writing Your Own Image Plugin
=============================

Pillow uses a plugin model which allows you to add your own
decoders to the library, without any changes to the library
itself. Such plugins usually have names like
:file:`XxxImagePlugin.py`, where ``Xxx`` is a unique format name
(usually an abbreviation).

.. warning:: Pillow >= 2.1.0 no longer automatically imports any file
             in the Python path with a name ending in
             :file:`ImagePlugin.py`.  You will need to import your
             image plugin manually.

Pillow decodes files in two stages:

1. It loops over the available image plugins in the loaded order, and
   calls the plugin's ``_accept`` function with the first 16 bytes of
   the file. If the ``_accept`` function returns true, the plugin's
   ``_open`` method is called to set up the image metadata and image
   tiles. The ``_open`` method is not for decoding the actual image
   data.
2. When the image data is requested, the ``ImageFile.load`` method is
   called, which sets up a decoder for each tile and feeds the data to
   it.

An image plugin should contain a format handler derived from the
:py:class:`PIL.ImageFile.ImageFile` base class. This class should
provide an ``_open`` method, which reads the file header and
sets up at least the :py:attr:`~PIL.Image.Image.mode` and
:py:attr:`~PIL.Image.Image.size` attributes. To be able to load the
file, the method must also create a list of ``tile`` descriptors,
which contain a decoder name, extents of the tile, and
any decoder-specific data. The format handler class must be explicitly
registered, via a call to the :py:mod:`~PIL.Image` module.

.. note:: For performance reasons, it is important that the
  ``_open`` method quickly rejects files that do not have the
  appropriate contents.

Example
-------

The following plugin supports a simple format, which has a 128-byte header
consisting of the words “SPAM” followed by the width, height, and pixel size in
bits. The header fields are separated by spaces. The image data follows
directly after the header, and can be either bi-level, greyscale, or 24-bit
true color.

**SpamImagePlugin.py**::

    from PIL import Image, ImageFile


    def _accept(prefix):
        return prefix[:4] == b"SPAM"


    class SpamImageFile(ImageFile.ImageFile):

        format = "SPAM"
        format_description = "Spam raster image"

        def _open(self):

            header = self.fp.read(128).split()

            # size in pixels (width, height)
            self._size = int(header[1]), int(header[2])

            # mode setting
            bits = int(header[3])
            if bits == 1:
                self.mode = "1"
            elif bits == 8:
                self.mode = "L"
            elif bits == 24:
                self.mode = "RGB"
            else:
                raise SyntaxError("unknown number of bits")

            # data descriptor
            self.tile = [("raw", (0, 0) + self.size, 128, (self.mode, 0, 1))]


    Image.register_open(SpamImageFile.format, SpamImageFile, _accept)

    Image.register_extensions(
        SpamImageFile.format,
        [
            ".spam",
            ".spa",  # DOS version
        ],
    )


The format handler must always set the
:py:attr:`~PIL.Image.Image.size` and :py:attr:`~PIL.Image.Image.mode`
attributes. If these are not set, the file cannot be opened. To
simplify the plugin, the calling code considers exceptions like
:py:exc:`SyntaxError`, :py:exc:`KeyError`, :py:exc:`IndexError`,
:py:exc:`EOFError` and :py:exc:`struct.error` as a failure to identify
the file.

Note that the image plugin must be explicitly registered using
:py:func:`PIL.Image.register_open`. Although not required, it is also a good
idea to register any extensions used by this format.

Once the plugin has been imported, it can be used:

.. code-block:: python

    from PIL import Image
    import SpamImagePlugin

    with Image.open("hopper.spam") as im:
        pass

The ``tile`` attribute
----------------------

To be able to read the file as well as just identifying it, the ``tile``
attribute must also be set. This attribute consists of a list of tile
descriptors, where each descriptor specifies how data should be loaded to a
given region in the image. In most cases, only a single descriptor is used,
covering the full image.

The tile descriptor is a 4-tuple with the following contents::

    (decoder, region, offset, parameters)

The fields are used as follows:

**decoder**
    Specifies which decoder to use. The ``raw`` decoder used here supports
    uncompressed data, in a variety of pixel formats. For more information on
    this decoder, see the description below.

**region**
    A 4-tuple specifying where to store data in the image.

**offset**
    Byte offset from the beginning of the file to image data.

**parameters**
    Parameters to the decoder. The contents of this field depends on the
    decoder specified by the first field in the tile descriptor tuple. If the
    decoder doesn’t need any parameters, use :data:`None` for this field.

Note that the ``tile`` attribute contains a list of tile descriptors,
not just a single descriptor.

Decoders
========

The raw decoder
---------------

The ``raw`` decoder is used to read uncompressed data from an image file. It
can be used with most uncompressed file formats, such as PPM, BMP, uncompressed
TIFF, and many others. To use the raw decoder with the
:py:func:`PIL.Image.frombytes` function, use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    image = Image.frombytes(
        mode, size, data, "raw",
        raw_mode, stride, orientation
        )

When used in a tile descriptor, the parameter field should look like::

    (raw_mode, stride, orientation)

The fields are used as follows:

**raw_mode**
    The pixel layout used in the file, and is used to properly convert data to
    PIL’s internal layout. For a summary of the available formats, see the
    table below.

**stride**
    The distance in bytes between two consecutive lines in the image. If 0, the
    image is assumed to be packed (no padding between lines). If omitted, the
    stride defaults to 0.

**orientation**
    Whether the first line in the image is the top line on the screen (1), or
    the bottom line (-1). If omitted, the orientation defaults to 1.

The **raw mode** field is used to determine how the data should be unpacked to
match PIL’s internal pixel layout. PIL supports a large set of raw modes; for a
complete list, see the table in the :file:`Unpack.c` module. The following
table describes some commonly used **raw modes**:

+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mode      | description                                                       |
+===========+===================================================================+
| ``1``     | | 1-bit bilevel, stored with the leftmost pixel in the most       |
|           | | significant bit. 0 means black, 1 means white.                  |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``1;I``   | | 1-bit inverted bilevel, stored with the leftmost pixel in the   |
|           | | most significant bit. 0 means white, 1 means black.             |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``1;R``   | | 1-bit reversed bilevel, stored with the leftmost pixel in the   |
|           | | least significant bit. 0 means black, 1 means white.            |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``L``     | 8-bit greyscale. 0 means black, 255 means white.                  |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``L;I``   | 8-bit inverted greyscale. 0 means white, 255 means black.         |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``P``     | 8-bit palette-mapped image.                                       |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``RGB``   | 24-bit true colour, stored as (red, green, blue).                 |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``BGR``   | 24-bit true colour, stored as (blue, green, red).                 |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``RGBX``  | | 24-bit true colour, stored as (red, green, blue, pad). The pad  |
|           | | pixels may vary.                                                |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``RGB;L`` | | 24-bit true colour, line interleaved (first all red pixels, then|
|           | | all green pixels, finally all blue pixels).                     |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

Note that for the most common cases, the raw mode is simply the same as the mode.

The Python Imaging Library supports many other decoders, including JPEG, PNG,
and PackBits. For details, see the :file:`decode.c` source file, and the
standard plugin implementations provided with the library.

Decoding floating point data
----------------------------

PIL provides some special mechanisms to allow you to load a wide variety of
formats into a mode ``F`` (floating point) image memory.

You can use the ``raw`` decoder to read images where data is packed in any
standard machine data type, using one of the following raw modes:

============ =======================================
mode         description
============ =======================================
``F``        32-bit native floating point.
``F;8``      8-bit unsigned integer.
``F;8S``     8-bit signed integer.
``F;16``     16-bit little endian unsigned integer.
``F;16S``    16-bit little endian signed integer.
``F;16B``    16-bit big endian unsigned integer.
``F;16BS``   16-bit big endian signed integer.
``F;16N``    16-bit native unsigned integer.
``F;16NS``   16-bit native signed integer.
``F;32``     32-bit little endian unsigned integer.
``F;32S``    32-bit little endian signed integer.
``F;32B``    32-bit big endian unsigned integer.
``F;32BS``   32-bit big endian signed integer.
``F;32N``    32-bit native unsigned integer.
``F;32NS``   32-bit native signed integer.
``F;32F``    32-bit little endian floating point.
``F;32BF``   32-bit big endian floating point.
``F;32NF``   32-bit native floating point.
``F;64F``    64-bit little endian floating point.
``F;64BF``   64-bit big endian floating point.
``F;64NF``   64-bit native floating point.
============ =======================================

The bit decoder
---------------

If the raw decoder cannot handle your format, PIL also provides a special “bit”
decoder that can be used to read various packed formats into a floating point
image memory.

To use the bit decoder with the :py:func:`PIL.Image.frombytes` function, use
the following syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    image = Image.frombytes(
        mode, size, data, "bit",
        bits, pad, fill, sign, orientation
        )

When used in a tile descriptor, the parameter field should look like::

    (bits, pad, fill, sign, orientation)

The fields are used as follows:

**bits**
    Number of bits per pixel (2-32). No default.

**pad**
    Padding between lines, in bits. This is either 0 if there is no padding, or
    8 if lines are padded to full bytes. If omitted, the pad value defaults to
    8.

**fill**
    Controls how data are added to, and stored from, the decoder bit buffer.

**fill=0**
    Add bytes to the LSB end of the decoder buffer; store pixels from the MSB
    end.

**fill=1**
    Add bytes to the MSB end of the decoder buffer; store pixels from the MSB
    end.

**fill=2**
    Add bytes to the LSB end of the decoder buffer; store pixels from the LSB
    end.

**fill=3**
    Add bytes to the MSB end of the decoder buffer; store pixels from the LSB
    end.

    If omitted, the fill order defaults to 0.

**sign**
    If non-zero, bit fields are sign extended. If zero or omitted, bit fields
    are unsigned.

**orientation**
    Whether the first line in the image is the top line on the screen (1), or
    the bottom line (-1). If omitted, the orientation defaults to 1.

Writing Your Own File Decoder in C
==================================

There are 3 stages in a file decoder's lifetime:

1. Setup: Pillow looks for a function in the decoder registry, falling
   back to a function named ``[decodername]_decoder`` on the internal
   core image object.  That function is called with the ``args`` tuple
   from the ``tile`` setup in the ``_open`` method.

2. Decoding: The decoder's decode function is repeatedly called with
   chunks of image data.

3. Cleanup: If the decoder has registered a cleanup function, it will
   be called at the end of the decoding process, even if there was an
   exception raised.


Setup
-----

The current conventions are that the decoder setup function is named
``PyImaging_[Decodername]DecoderNew`` and defined in ``decode.c``. The
python binding for it is named ``[decodername]_decoder`` and is setup
from within the ``_imaging.c`` file in the codecs section of the
function array.

The setup function needs to call ``PyImaging_DecoderNew`` and at the
very least, set the ``decode`` function pointer. The fields of
interest in this object are:

**decode**
  Function pointer to the decode function, which has access to
  ``im``, ``state``, and the buffer of data to be added to the image.

**cleanup**
  Function pointer to the cleanup function, has access to ``state``.

**im**
  The target image, will be set by Pillow.

**state**
  An ImagingCodecStateInstance, will be set by Pillow. The ``context``
  member is an opaque struct that can be used by the decoder to store
  any format specific state or options.

**pulls_fd**
  **EXPERIMENTAL** -- **WARNING**, interface may change. If set to 1,
  ``state->fd`` will be a pointer to the Python file like object.  The
  decoder may use the functions in ``codec_fd.c`` to read directly
  from the file like object rather than have the data pushed through a
  buffer.  Note that this implementation may be refactored until this
  warning is removed.

  .. versionadded:: 3.3.0


Decoding
--------

The decode function is called with the target (core) image, the
decoder state structure, and a buffer of data to be decoded.

**Experimental** -- If ``pulls_fd`` is set, then the decode function
is called once, with an empty buffer. It is the decoder's
responsibility to decode the entire tile in that one call.  The rest of
this section only applies if ``pulls_fd`` is not set.

It is the decoder's responsibility to pull as much data as possible
out of the buffer and return the number of bytes consumed. The next
call to the decoder will include the previous unconsumed tail. The
decoder function will be called multiple times as the data is read
from the file like object.

If an error occurs, set ``state->errcode`` and return -1.

Return -1 on success, without setting the errcode.

Cleanup
-------

The cleanup function is called after the decoder returns a negative
value, or if there is a read error from the file. This function should
free any allocated memory and release any resources from external
libraries.

.. _file-decoders-py:

Writing Your Own File Decoder in Python
=======================================

Python file decoders should derive from
:py:class:`PIL.ImageFile.PyDecoder` and should at least override the
decode method. File decoders should be registered using
:py:meth:`PIL.Image.register_decoder`. As in the C implementation of
the file decoders, there are three stages in the lifetime of a
Python-based file decoder:

1. Setup: Pillow looks for the decoder in the registry, then
   instantiates the class.

2. Decoding: The decoder instance's ``decode`` method is repeatedly
   called with a buffer of data to be interpreted.

3. Cleanup: The decoder instance's ``cleanup`` method is called.
